# ezSMT
An API for SMT solving with various solvers. This is a work in progress and there's still lots to be done.

# Current Solvers
Currently supports some features of CVC4 and Z3

# Unit Tests
Tests can only be run one folder at a time i.e. relaxed or strict. This has to do with the configuration and imports.
